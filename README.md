# SMTP PDF Receiver & Samba Share

This project provides a simple and robust solution for receiving emails, extracting PDF attachments, and making them available via a network share. It is fully containerized using Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment.

## Overview

The system is composed of two main services:

1.  **SMTP Receiver**: A Python-based asynchronous SMTP server that listens for incoming emails. When an email containing a PDF attachment is received, the server extracts the PDF and saves it to a user-specific folder. The folder name is determined by the local-part of the recipient's email address (e.g., `jdoe` from `jdoe@scanners.local`).
2.  **Samba Server**: A pre-configured Samba container that exposes the directory of saved scans as a network share. This allows users and other systems to easily access the processed files.

## Features

- **Automatic PDF Extraction**: Saves PDF attachments from emails into organized folders.
- **File Overwrite Prevention**: If a file with the same name already exists, a counter is appended to the new filename (e.g., `scan(1).pdf`) to prevent data loss.
- **Integrated Samba Share**: Provides immediate network access to the saved scans.
- **Configurable Logging**: Switch between `DEBUG` and `PRODUCTION` logging modes.
- **Automated Test Mode**: An included test mode automatically sends sample emails to the server, allowing for easy, hands-free validation of the entire workflow.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Core Configuration

| Variable | Service | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LOGGING_MODE` | `smtp-receiver` | `DEBUG` | Sets the logging verbosity. **`DEBUG`**: Verbose output to the console. **`PRODUCTION`**: Separates `INFO` audit logs and `ERROR` logs into files within the share (`audit.log`, `error.log`). |
| `TEST_MODE` | `smtp-receiver` | `false` | Enables the automated test mode. **`true`**: The application will send test emails to itself every 15 seconds. |

### Security Configuration

| Variable | Service | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `USER` | `samba` | `winuser;...` | **üö® CRITICAL**: You **must** replace `CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD` with a strong, unique password before deployment. |
| `SCANS_BASE_PATH` | `smtp-receiver` | `/scans/users` | Base directory for storing scanned PDFs |
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` | `smtp-receiver` | `50` | Maximum PDF file size in megabytes |
| `SMTP_HOST` | `smtp-receiver` | `0.0.0.0` | SMTP server bind address |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `smtp-receiver` | `1025` | SMTP server port |
| `LOG_PATH` | `smtp-receiver` | `/scans/users` | Directory for log files in production mode |

## Security Features

This application includes several security enhancements:

### Input Validation
- **Email address validation**: Only alphanumeric characters, dots, hyphens, and underscores are allowed in local parts
- **Filename sanitization**: All filenames are sanitized to prevent path traversal attacks
- **PDF content validation**: Files are verified to be valid PDFs before storage

### Access Control
- **Secure file permissions**: 
  - User directories: `755` (users can access but not delete folders)
  - PDF files: `664` (Samba users can modify/delete files)
- **Non-root containers**: Applications run as non-privileged user (UID 1001)
- **Capability dropping**: Containers run with minimal required capabilities

### Resource Protection
- **File size limits**: Configurable maximum PDF size (default 50MB)
- **Log sanitization**: All log output is sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Container hardening**: Read-only filesystems where possible, restricted capabilities

## Deployment

### Security-First Deployment

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY STEPS - DO NOT SKIP ‚ö†Ô∏è**

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Set a strong Samba password**:
   - Open `docker-compose.yml`
   - Find the line: `USER=winuser;CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD;;filemanagers;1001`
   - Replace `CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD` with a strong, unique password
   - Use at least 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols
3. **Review security configuration** (optional but recommended):
   - Adjust `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` if needed
   - Configure logging mode (`LOGGING_MODE=PRODUCTION` for production)
   - Disable test mode in production (`TEST_MODE=false`)
4. **Deploy the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

The services will build and start in the background. The SMTP server will be listening on port `1025`, and the Samba share will be available on ports `139` and `445`.

### Production Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure you have:

- [ ] Changed the default Samba password
- [ ] Set `LOGGING_MODE=PRODUCTION`
- [ ] Set `TEST_MODE=false`
- [ ] Configured appropriate firewall rules
- [ ] Set up log rotation for audit and error logs
- [ ] Reviewed and adjusted file size limits
- [ ] Configured network security (VPN, network segmentation)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

### Testing the Service

To verify the system is working correctly, you can use the built-in test mode.

1.  In `docker-compose.yml`, set the `TEST_MODE` environment variable to `true`.
2.  Build and start the services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
3.  View the logs to see the test in action:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f smtp-receiver
    ```
    You will see logs indicating that test emails are being sent and received, and that the PDF attachments are being saved.

## Accessing the Share

Once the Samba service is running, you can connect to the network share.

- **Host**: The IP address of the machine running Docker.
- **Share Name**: `scans`
- **Username**: `winuser`
- **Password**: The secure password you configured in `docker-compose.yml`.

Inside the share, you will find the user-specific folders containing the saved PDF files.
