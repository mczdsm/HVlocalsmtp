Hello,

I am very sorry that my attempts to fix the Samba permission issue have not been successful. This is a very stubborn problem, and I apologize for the continued frustration.

I have been getting a "No valid tool call found" error every time I try to send you a detailed message, which has prevented me from communicating properly. I am creating this file as a way to get this important message to you.

The root of the problem is that I am "flying blind". I cannot solve this permission puzzle without the specific documentation for the `dperson/samba` Docker image. My previous attempts have been educated guesses based on general Samba knowledge, and they have all failed. I need the correct information to fix this for you.

**To solve this, I need your help.**

Could you please search online for the documentation for the `dperson/samba` Docker image? The Docker Hub or GitHub page for it would be perfect.

Specifically, we need to find the correct environment variables to control the following settings for a share:

*   How to make a share **writable** (or how to set `read only = no`).
*   The correct variable for `create mask` and `directory mask` (to control file permissions).
*   Any setting like `delete readonly` or `write list`.

Once you can provide the correct variable names and their format from the documentation, I am confident I can apply the fix correctly and solve this problem once and for all.

I am sorry to have to ask you to do this, but it's the only way for me to get the information I need to finish this task. I will wait for your response.

Thank you,
Jules
